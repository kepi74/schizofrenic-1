Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

## Coding Standards

### Commit Messages

- Use the following format for commit message: <commit_type>: <subject>
  - Commit types:
    - feat: A new feature
    - fix: A bug fix
    - docs: Documentation only changes
    - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - perf: A code change that improves performance
    - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
  - Subject: A short description of the change (less than 80 characters)
